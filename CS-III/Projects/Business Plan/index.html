          <h2 style="text-align:center">Identity</h2>
          <p> Our business works to convert code in one programming language to another. Our first conversion will be from Swift to C++ and have conversions for a lot of basic functions that are typically used.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Problem</h2>
          <p>Translating code between languages is an extremely time consuming process, as code structures between languages are not a one to one comparison. Additionally, modern languages such as JavaScript and Python are extremely readable and perfect for quickly writing programs, however they can be incredibly slow with increasing complexity and length of program due to being interpreted language. Conversely, C++ is a compiled language that compiles directly to machine code, and is thus very fast, but can be hard to read and develop quickly. Because of this, developers often choose slower overall languages and then have to work to make as many optimizations as possible on simple programs to compensate for the speed issue.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Our Solution</h2>
          <p>The way to deal with this problem is to create a software that translates a slower yet easily understood language into one that is a more difficult to understand but faster language. This product will be run on a website which will allow users to input either a text file(while selecting a language) or the file type of the language. The product will start with conversions from Swift to C++ as a proof of concept, due to Swift being simple and having a lot of specifications for declarations.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Target Market</h2>
          <p>Our target audience will be programmers who are looking to increase the speed of their code, as our program will provide an easy way to create programs quickly and with less hassle. Programmers who wish to convert legacy programs will also eventually become a target, if the project goes to a point where converting legacy languages to more modern languages is feasible.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">The Competiton</h2>
          <p>There exist some minor code converters, but many have clunky mechanics and do not convert Swift to C++ or vice versa. They tend to switch around variable names, and make the code more of a hassle to read with their methods of converting code. We will attempt to improve on some of the shortcomings of these services, while also attempting to maintain what they get right.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Revenue Streams</h2>
          <p>We are not in need of funds currently, but our current plans to gain funds is to place ads on our website so that when users go to our website, we can gain some revenue off of the adsense. We also may fundraise through going to events, however this is a last resort if necessary.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Marketing Activities</h2>
          <p>We will likely market through paying for and creating advertisements once the product is nearing completion, and a large amount of code structures can be easily converted. We will use Google Ads to promote our service on different platforms, and the targeted ad system will be able to reach the correct demographic.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Expenses</h2>
          <p>The only possible expenses are in the form of paying for advertising through Google Ads and domain hosting. Google Ads would only come into play at the end of the project, as the product would be close to release at that point; however that is only if ads are necessary or probable. In the case there are ads, the ad rate would be capped at $20 a month. Domain hosting would only be necessary if we want to move it off the Codermerlin server to add advertisements to the website, however it is currently not necessary. We would likely run off a trial for free on GoDaddy or enter a payment plan that would only be at most $7 a month.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Team and Key Roles</h2>
          <p>Currently, there are four team members: Neeraj Gogate, Vivek Maranganti, Karthik Peravali, and Evan Ye. Everyone on the team will be both a backend developer and a frontend developer, as there is not a significant amount of front end development needed to justify having a separate team. As the project nears completion, however, the roles of front end and backend will likely be defined with the necessity of polishing the website.</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Milestones</h2>
          <p>As the business grows, we will move into adding more support for more languages, especially ones that have more untraditional ways of making declarations and flexible rules of type casting. We will also expand on the libraries present to include the ability to create libraries that operate the way the original languages intended it.</p>
