          <p>I’ve always been interested in artificial intelligence, so this project immediately gravitated to me. I really like the concept of making machine learning algorithms that can play popular web games, and I also believe that artificial intelligence as a field of computer science should be taught more to make it less frightening for people, but I don’t really see how it will help teach people, as I think the concepts of artificial intelligence discussed in the proposal are rather well known components of artificial intelligence.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/suhraab-alimi/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Stefano Tower Defense HD</a></h1>
          <p>Creating a tower defense game sounds like it could be a lot of fun to create since Suhraab is one of my good friends. Game development is an extremely excruciating process but like with most computer science fields, the relief and calmness that comes from completing a project is a lot greater than the anxiety while completing it. The only problem I really have is that I am making a lot of Unity projects this year, and I want to branch out a bit past it.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/vijay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Child in Hot Car Detector</a></h1>
          <p>The problem described is one that actually needs to be addressed, and the idea of detecting if a kid is left alone in a car is an amazing one. I think it could easily detect if a child is in the car with the addition of a thermal sensor, I just think the idea has a couple of problems. Young children who are susceptible to dying in a hot car typically die in about fifteen minutes, so if a child was left in a car the police would need to be called immediately to ensure they get there in time.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">DX3</a></h1>
          <p>Detecting if someone is sleeping sounds like it could be amazing, I just don’t know if it would work in concept. The proposal said it would use facial recognition, but I don’t think that would be really possible in real life, cause the camera would have to be faced directly at the person’s face. It also sounds like a project you could easily get a lawsuit for, as the shock system could go wrong if it's bugged.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Universal Business Card</a></h1>
          <p>The idea of having a physical card that acts as a universal business card sounds really great in theory, I just don’t know if it would be possible to. It would require some major connections to market and either make enough people download the app or somehow convince Apple and Android to add it on the hardware side. Additionally, I think it could be achieved with a card that has a QR code on it.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/qasem-abdelijaber/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Self-Unlocking VPN</a></h1>
          <p>A VPN that unblocks itself would be really useful considering how the school blocks anything and everything, even when it makes no sense (inspect element). The only problem is I know the school is going to shut it down from the inside the second it starts working, and I really don’t want to be on the school’s bad side in senior year.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Time Travel Game</a></h1>
          <p>A game based on time travel sounds like it could be a lot of fun to play, but sounds like a nightmare to actually make. Time travel is notoriously hard to write well, so coding it would not be any better. Also, once again this sounds like it would be done in Unity, and I am no longer joining any Unity projects.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/du-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Balance One-Wheeler</a></h1>
          <p>Making a one-wheeler balance sounds like it could be a nice delve into the hardware side of computer programming, which is an area I haven’t really delved into yet. It also sounds like it wouldn’t be incredibly hard, but keeping up with physics in the real world might cause some challenges to that idea. The only problem I have with joining the project is that I feel like I would bring the team down considering how I don’t know remotely anything about how to make a robot balance.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/andrew.eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Stalker Detection</a></h1>
          <p>Having an app that detects when someone is looking at your screen sounds like it could be pretty useful in school for both students and teachers, as it would allow students to do what they want to do while also providing teachers with another way to protect test privacy. That being said however, I am not sure if it is really possible to make such a setup for something like this, so I don’t particularly want to do this project.</p>
          <h1 style="text-align:center;margin:auto"><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/neeraj.gogate/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" class="nav-link">Codle Translate</a></h1>
          <p>This is the project I created and I would like to see it go through, as I think it could be a useful resource that could expand further into a larger project that I could work on for a while. It has a certain difficulty to it that would both be able to challenge me, while also not leaving me totally confused as to what’s going on. Additionally, I am really tired of having to design UIs, so such a project would give me a break from that because it doesn’t really require that much of a UI.</p>
