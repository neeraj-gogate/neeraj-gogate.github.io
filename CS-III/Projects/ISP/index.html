            <p style="text-align:center;">Modern programming languages feature a lot more functionality and flexibility than their older predecessors, making them easier and quicker to write code for. However, this increased functionality results in these languages sacrificing speed in basic functions, as they have to perform more actions to convert to machine code. Because of this, when writing large programs, developers often have to write them in low-level difficult older languages, as writing them in modern languages would cause the program to be slow and tedious to use. To alleviate this problem, Code Translate is a service that helps developers translate their code from one programming language to another. All they have to do is visit Code Translateâ€™s website (COMING SOON), select what languages they want to convert to and from, and paste their code in. The website will then output a version of their code in a different language, all without the hassle of re-evaluating logic and writing code in a new language. Currently Swift to C++ conversion is in the beginning phases of development, and will release a beta version by the end of April.</p>
