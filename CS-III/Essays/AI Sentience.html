            The current media landscape, most often science fiction pieces,
            depict Sentient Artificial Intelligence (AI), the development of
            machines that simulate human actions, as an apocalyptic future that
            will doom the human race. This can be seen through the movie
            Avengers: Age of Ultron, which depicts the titular villain, Ultron,
            as he immediately tries to eliminate the human race after reading
            all of human records. While this type of story is perfect for works
            of fiction through its thrilling plot, this type of idea does not
            track very well to real life, as Sentient Artificial Intelligence
            would likely result in them integrating into society very well.
          </p>
          <h1>AIs Today</h1>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            In its current form, AI is truly nowhere near sentient. Many AIs
            today are made for much simpler tasks and still have imperfections
            in the way they’re created (Metz 2022). Most AI’s today boil down to
            a combination of parsing through data looking for relevant
            information and an algorithm based on past statistics collected by
            data scientists (Burns, 2021). An example of one of these algorithms
            are algorithms used by either YouTube and TikTok, which use their
            algorithms to figure out what videos users are watching and
            interacting with the most, and then recommending videos that match
            the user’s tastes. This algorithm is incredibly effective and
            accurate at predicting a user's tastes after the user watches about
            50-60 videos, but there are some problems with the algorithm,
            specifically that it’s too good at what it does. Often the algorithm
            gets stuck in a niche that's impossible to get out without watching
            a large amount of videos. This sounds great at first, but this is
            problematic with the high abundance of political videos on YouTube.
            Getting stuck in a niche in political style videos often happens at
            extremely polarizing parts of the political spectrum, and getting
            stuck at these ends often means that people can’t get to the
            opposing end of YouTube which means that people aren’t exposed to as
            many differing views and can become stuck in their ways. A newer
            form of AI has gotten a bit more complicated with images parsing,
            with DALL-E. DALL-E takes images from the internet and uses them to
            generate images from user entered prompts (Roose, 2022). However, it
            does have some problems as it can produce some images which aren’t
            entirely perfect. While it is rather great at making landscapes and
            environments, it isn’t as great at making characters as it can often
            smudge in certain cases. Despite these problems, however, these AIs
            are constantly improving, and eventually we may reach a point where
            these AIs are virtually indistinguishable from humans.
          </p>
          <h1>AIs Won't Revolt</h1>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            If AIs were highly specialized machines meant to complete a large
            variety of tasks done by humans rather than the highly specialized
            AIs with no proficiency in any other skills the world is trending
            towards, then the AIs would most likely be on the side of humanity
            rather than being the ones to cause an apocalypse .The primary
            reason for this is that they would most likely reinforce ideals of
            unity and peace present in our world today. If the AIs were to parse
            through and read through data present on the modern internet through
            reliable sources, they would most likely pick up ideals that are
            similar to the ideals held in countries with reliable internet
            connections, as those would be the ones most commonly held on the
            internet. This would result in the AIs having an ideology of the
            average of all internet users, thus making them have rather
            agreeable positions that would not conflict too heavily(unless there
            is a huge disparity in opinion). This would allow the AIs to be
            nothing more than an assistant to humanity, as they would allow
            humanity to complete tasks at a much faster rate than humanly
            possible, while also solving problems and allowing humanity to focus
            on smaller issues. Solving problems such as food shortages, water
            problems, and housing inequality across the globe with these AIs
            through removal of most of the middle management by humans would
            result in humanity being able to focus on issues that are rather
            trivial comparatively. Since people’s basic needs will be met
            relatively easily, the need for capitalistic systems will no longer
            apply. People would be able to focus more on what they are truly
            interested in as the need for advancement will be depleted
            significantly. This would result in less competition among people,
            drastically removing a lot of the mental health issues people have,
            as people are able to be more relaxed in their jobs. It would
            essentially create a utopia for humans. Despite this, there is one
            critical flaw with this type of technology.
          </p>
          <h1>Ethics of Using AIs</h1>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            While the AI being sentient would most likely not cause many
            problems relating to the extinction or enslavement of the human
            race, there would be an extreme problem regarding the ethics of
            letting the robot complete tasks. This problem would be related to
            the definition of sentient being “responsive to or conscious of
            sense impressions” (Merriam-Webster, 2009). If an AI was truly able
            to have emotions (for the sake of argument, let’s say through some
            chemical engineering relating to brain wave patterns) utilizing it
            for working rather than humans would bring into question whether
            they have certain rights. If they are able to simulate human
            emotions and actually in some way feel human emotion, then they
            would need to have some sort of protection in the law, as treating
            them as inferior to humans would be deprecating to them and border
            on the lines of enslavement.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            Although a form of highly-advanced sentient AI can be extremely
            beneficial to society, there are major problems relating to the
            morality of letting them be sentient and treating them as tools to
            society rather than sentient beings.
